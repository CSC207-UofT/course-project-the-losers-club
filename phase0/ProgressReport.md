## Progress Report

### Summary of Specification, CRC Card, the Walkthrough, and the Skeleton program:

The project is to implement the Crazy 8's card game in Java while applying the design principles we have been learning 
in lecture. The implementation currently consists of 3 entity classes, 3 use case classes, and 1 controller class. 
The program can be run by running the main file, and the console will display inputs and the game state of Crazy 8's.


### Questions:
1. Should we refactor the entity classes such that the Deck class does not implement Card objects?
2. Should we make the Hand Class Abstract to implement different games?
3. Should we implement playing field as its own class?

### What has worked well:

Our project group has altogether been organized and communicating clearly. The design of the project is intuitive 
and our implementation displays the design's clarity. The design of the project also allows different group members 
to work on different sections of the project at the same time, which allows for better efficiency.
